# lsml23
Notebooks for the [2023 course on Large Scale Machine Learning at Mines ParisTech](https://people.minesparis.psl.eu/fabien.moutarde/ES_LSML/LSML-23_LargeScaleMachineLearning.htm).

## Day 1: Introduction to large scale ML
* If you are familiar with `scikit-learn` (for example, Mines students who had Data Science in their first year or took "Apprentissage artificiel" previously), work on notebook `1_sklearn_at_scale.ipynb`.
* If you are not familiar with `scikit-learn`, you can start with [this notebook](https://github.com/chagaz/ml-notebooks/tree/master/intro-ml-genetics) to get a hang of things. 

## Day 2: Deep Learning, AutoEncoders and GANs
* If you have never trained convolutional neural networks on `keras`, start with [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IZPUwaNeE5HpI-xn2PqOwnLLp-U3e9FL?usp=sharing) to train a LeNet Deep Convolutional Network on MNIST. 
* Practice transfer-learning using a standard ConvNet pre-trained on ImageNet with [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SadnM3Hnklj5vQQX9N4gIWNmt_0ITHwo?usp=sharing)
* **Practice unsupervised deep learning with auto-encoders and GAN with [this notebook](https://github.com/JosephGesnouin/Unsup_gener_nets/blob/main/TP_modeles_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9ratifs.ipynb)**

Beginners should work on TP1 (LeNet on MNIST), and then at least begin TP3 (Deep Generative Models)
**Students who have already practised with Deep ConvNets should work essentially on TP3.** TP2 may be useful only for those who have never practised Transfer Learning.

## Day 3: Deep reinforcement learing
Instructions inside `3_deep_reinforcement_learning.pdf`. The notebook is [here](https://githubtocolab.com/telejesus2/tprl-lsml-2022/blob/main/tprl_lsml_2022.ipynb).

## Day 4: Stochastic gradient descent
Work on notebook `4_stochastic_gradient_descent.ipynb`.

## Day 5: Natural Language Processing with Recurrent Neural Networks and Transformers
Work on notebook `5_nlp_rnn.ipynb`.


## Setup
To run the notebooks, you will need Python, [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) (either JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook), and number of Python librairies. The easiest way to install of this is to use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) and set up an environment specific to this course using the file `package_list.yml`. To this end, you can either:
* if you prefer graphical user interfaces: (1) [install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) and (2) follow the instructions under "Importing an environment" [of the tutorial](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/manage-environments/) to import the environment in `package_list.yml`;
* if you prefer the command line: (1) [install conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and (2) use the following instructions in the command line:
```bash
   conda env create -f package_list.yml -n lsml
   conda activate lsml
```
